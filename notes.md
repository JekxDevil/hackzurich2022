# Dataset - intro climate data

## Topics

- glaciers
- energy
- public transportation

## Correlations

- Daily min, mean and max temperature:
  - weather be
  - climate be
  - cold, coldest and its frequency
  - heat, hottest and its frequency
  - ++comparison

- Daily precipitation sum:
  - Floods
  - Raise lake levels
  - Secure concernings at dams

- Daily mean global radiation:
  - skin concerns
  - cumulative potential effects (mention sources)
  - sight concerns
  - alimentary concerns

- Daily mean relative humidity:
  - skin issues
  - asma people issues
  - insomnia issues
  - insects infestations
  - low energy and letargy (sources)
  - spending more time in cold places, thus increase CO2 emissions

- Daily mean near surface wind speed:
  - buildings
  - leisure places unpracticality
  - new dangerous phenomenon (typhoon, tornado, hurricane)
  - indirect terrain unproduction
  - birds nest concerns

## Questions

All questions could be presented with a gif of a possible climate tendency in the following years for a specific region.
A UI could be similar to trivia crack questions.
App as a game oriented to make the internation divulgative research regarding climate change affecting personal spaces to be seen by people.
A UI could also comprend always a **More About** at the end the complement the 'pills'.
Always provide a link to the Open Source data and Official Authority Agencies.

- Temperature:
  - Will `location` potentially reach the temperature of `degrees` in `time`?
  - Could you imagine `location` have `weather phenomenon/climate tendency` in `time`?
  - Which of the following locations could have the same `weather phenomenon/climate tendency` as `location`? `locations`. _multiple choice_
  - Have you ever imagine `near location` have `weather danger`? _insert fact_

- Precipitation:
  - In `time` the area of `location` could be subjected to `precipitation danger related`
  - Did you know that `building` capacity limit is `number` and in `time` the occupied capacity could reach `number`?

- Radiation:
  - Did you know that the `human at-risk surface` is subjected to potential damage with levels of `number` radiation
  and in the following `years` we could reach `number` potentially
  - _Basic divulgation article with `number` of radiation_. In `time` radiation levels could reach `number`. **More About**
  
- Humidity:
  - _basic divulgation article with `number` of humidity_. In `time` humidity levels could rech `number`. **More About**
  - Since `number` level of humidity, people are more likely to spend more time `action`, thus increasing CO2 emissions.

- Wind speed:
  - With `number` wind speeds, `locations` could be at `priority` risk. **More About**
  - `dangerous phenomenon` is likely to exist in `condition`, which is compatible with `condition` reachable in `time`. **More About**
  - _basic divulgation article with `number` of humidity_. In `time` wind speed levels could reach `number`. **More About**
